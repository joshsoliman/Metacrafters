# Error Handling in Solidity

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` in a Solidity smart contract.

## Features
- **Require:** Validates function inputs to ensure they meet necessary conditions.
- **Assert:** Ensures that critical invariants in the contract are not violated.
- **Revert:** Reverts state changes with a custom error message if conditions fail.

## Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed.
2. Hardhat framework for smart contract testing and deployment.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
